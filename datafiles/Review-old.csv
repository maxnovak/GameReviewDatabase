The mechanics are almost identical, though the formula benefits from a few decades of balance tweaks and subtle improvements. The hatin’ half of the game-playing population can make as much fun of me as they want, but I can’t help but fall in love all over again with Mario Kart when Nintendo executes the classic gameplay this well.""",9,1,1

Like a well-rounded set of trucks, balls, blocks, and figurines, Minecraft gives you the tools you need to bring your imagination to life. But with a real-time simulation constantly running, this is more like Toy Story than a LEGO set.""",9.15,2,1

For those who have been following the journeys of Desmond, Altaïr, and Ezio, this newest installment makes good on the promise implied by the title and serves up some big reveals about the ever-growing fiction. The core missions offer a level of cinematic immersion and tight design that is new to the series, and the plotline pulls together dangling story threads into a satisfying whole while simultaneously setting up the next game. While some questionable side missions and new gameplay concepts slow down the fun, they are only small flaws against the backdrop of a thrilling adventure. """,7.5,3,2
4,2011-11-22 12:00:00,IGN,10,"""Music has always been an important element of the Zelda series, increasingly so when Ocarina of Time tied gameplay and sound together over a decade ago. Skyward Sword represents a shift in that dynamic, confining the involvement of music and instruments largely to optional tasks or the plot itself. Don't expect acquiring the harp to significantly change how you'll play the game. Songs are generally discovered and played once as Link continues his adventure. Beyond that, expect to only play strings when Link needs a bit of extra health or wants a hint from a Gossip Stone.""",8.5,4,3

Look, I know the visuals look dated and a bit silly, but few games have visuals so endearing and charming. I know I'm not the only one who feels that way either, or else Minecraft's graphics wouldn't be so iconic. Could you take a texture from Gears of War, Halo or Uncharted, put it on a shirt and have players identify it? I doubt it. The looks just work, giving the game a super unique appearance that's memorable, and brings up a bit of nostalgia in me for 8-bit era games.""",6,2,4

The game's story not only involves Ezio's quest to uncover the secrets of his order, but his budding romance and entanglement in a complex political situation as well. Add in flashbacks to key moments in Altair's life and brief, optional excursions to Desmond's mind in the Animus and this plot is packed to the limit. """,8.8,3,3
